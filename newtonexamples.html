    <h2 align='center'>Of Newtons First Law</h2>
    <p align='center'>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by an outside force. This means that if a soccer ball is
    sitting in the grass, it will remain sitting still.</p><img align='center' src='soccer1.jpeg'><br>
    <p align='center'>But that also means that when an outside force acts on it, it flies across the grass.</p><img align='center' src='soccer2.jpeg><br>
    <h2 align='center'> That is an example of an object at rest being acted on by an outside force, but what about an object in motion being acted on by an outside
    force?</h2>
    <p align='center'>Imagine that you throw a baseball across the field to your friend. It keeps flying through the air for a few seconds...</p><img align='center' src='ball1.jpeg'><br>
    <p align='center'> Until it is caught by your friend. Your friend is the outside force.</p><img align='center' src='ball2.jpeg'>
